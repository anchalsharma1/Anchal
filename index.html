        tiger, (Panthera tigris), largest member of the cat family (Felidae), rivaled only by the lion (Panthera leo) in strength and ferocity.
        The tiger is endangered throughout its range, which stretches from the Russian Far East through parts of North Korea, China, India, and 
        Southeast Asia to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The Siberian, or Amur, tiger (P. tigris altaica) is the largest, measuring up to 
        4 metres (13 feet) in total length and weighing up to 300 kg (660 pounds). The Indian, or Bengal, tiger (P. tigris tigris) is the most
        numerous and accounts for about half of the total tiger population. Males are larger than females and may attain a shoulder height of
        about 1 metre and a length of about 2.2 metres, excluding a tail of about 1 metre; weight is 160–230 kg (350–500 pounds), and tigers
        from the south are smaller than those of the north.

        The tiger has adapted to a great variety of environments, from the Siberian taiga, where nights can be as cold as −40 °C (−40 °F), to the
        courts and temples and are at home in habitats ranging from dry grassland to rainforest. Grasslands, mixed grassland-forests, and 
        deciduous rather than densely canopied forests support maximum population densities, as these habitats maintain the highest number of 
        prey species. Having evolved in the temperate and subtropical forests of eastern Asia, the tiger is less tolerant of heat than other
        large cats, which may explain why it is an adept swimmer that appears to enjoy bathing. Under stress it may climb trees.A tiger's coat 
        pattern is still visible when it is shaved. This is not due to skin pigmentation, but to the stubble and hair follicles embedded in the
        skin.[54] It has a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males. The pupils are circular
        with yellow irises. The small, rounded ears have a prominent white spot on the back, surrounded by black.[22] These spots are thought to 
        play an important role in intraspecific communication.[55]
        The tiger's skull is similar to a lion's skull, with the frontal region usually less depressed or flattened, and a slightly longer
        postorbital region. The lion skull shows broader nasal openings. Due to the variation in skull sizes of the two species, the structure of
        the lower jaw is a reliable indicator for their identification.[18] The tiger has fairly stout teeth; its somewhat curved canines are the
        longest among living felids with a crown height of up to 90 mm (3.5 in).

        There is notable sexual dimorphism between male and female tigers, with the latter being consistently smaller. The size difference between
        them is proportionally greater in the large tiger subspecies, with males weighing up to 1.7 times more than females. Males also have wider
        forepaw pads, enabling sex to be identified from tracks.[56] It has been hypothesised that body size of different tiger populations may
        be correlated with climate and be explained by thermoregulation and Bergmann's rule, or by distribution and size of available prey
        species.
        Generally, males vary in total length from 220 to 310 cm (87 to 122 in) and weigh between 90 and 258 kg (198 and 569 lb) with skull length ranging
        from 295 to 383 mm (11.6 to 15.1 in). Females vary in total length from 190 to 275 cm (75 to 108 in), weigh 65 to 167 kg (143 to 368 lb) with 
        skull length ranging from 265 to 318 mm (10.4 to 12.5 in).[58] In either sex, the tail represents about 0.6 to 1.1 m (2 ft 0 in to 3 ft 7 in) of 
        the total length. The Bengal and Siberian tigers are amongst the tallest cats in shoulder height. They are also ranked among the biggest cats that
        have ever existed reaching weights of more than 300 kg (660 lb).[22] The tigers of the Sunda islands are smaller and less heavy than tigers in 
        mainland Asia, rarely exceeding 142 kg (313 lb) in weight.

            <p class="card-text">
                Tiger cubs go through a transient phase before they become true adults. They are chased away by their mothers when she has
                a new litter when they are around 2 and a half years old.
                Only around 7 tigers will survive this stage. They are unfamiliar with how to avoid humans and are not used to living on their own.
                The risks for them at this point in their lives are higher than at any point except immediately after birth. It will take another
                year for females, and as long as two years for males to reach full maturity.

            <p class="card-text">
                Male cubs are more adventurous and likely to roam further than females. This may partially explain why female
                cubs have a better chance of surviving unto adulthood. Many tiger cubs are killed when they first begin hunting, due to being 
                injured while trying to take down prey.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Like humans with brown eyes, tiger cubs are born with milky blue eyes. As they develop their eyes will slowly
                change to their signature gold color.
                The only tigers that maintain their blue eyes are white tigers. White tigers are not albino or a separate species but are white
                due to a genetic mutation which also causes blue eyes.</p>
